Their sale funds the purchase of real-world pizzas to throw a global pizza party every year on Bitcoin Pizza Day, May 22nd. This PizzaDAO project is an homage to Laszlo's purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin on May 22nd in 2010, the first recorded cryptocurrency transaction for real-world goods.
